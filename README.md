👋 Hey! I’m an Industrial Engineer based in Windsor, ON with a knack for streamlining processes and cutting waste in manufacturing. I’ve worked with Stellantis, Ford, and top-tier suppliers, focusing on quality, efficiency, and continuous improvement using Lean Six Sigma.

Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into data analytics and automation: learning Python, SQL, R, JS, and even dabbling in blockchain and AI to bring smarter solutions into industrial workflows.

🎓 I hold a B.A.Sc in Industrial Engineering + a BBA minor from the University of Windsor.

🛠️ Tools & Tech I use: Python, SQL, Power BI, AutoCAD, SAP, Azure, GCP, Lean tools, smart contracts, and more.

Right now, I’m building up my dev and data skills, exploring ways to merge tech and manufacturing. 

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate! 🚀
